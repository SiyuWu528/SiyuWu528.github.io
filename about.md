I passed my PhD qualifying exam with an outstanding score from The Pennsylvania State University, College of Information Sciences and Technology, advised by <a href="https://www.frankritter.com/ritter.html">Frank Ritter</a>.

In my work, I study neural symbolic AI and its integration with foundation models. Applications <a href="http://Siyuwu528.github.io/images/NeSyAI-ACS-2024_extended.pdf" target="_blank">cognitively-inspired decision intelligence for manufacturing</a> and

In my life, I dance, sing, walk, and cook for my family.
