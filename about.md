I passed my PhD qualifying exam with an outstanding score from The Pennsylvania State University, College of Information Sciences and Technology, under the guidance of Frank Ritter.
In my work, I study 
* Neural symbolic AI, applications including [autonomous driving] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Siyu-Wu-28/publication/370924635_Long_Road_Ahead_Lessons_Learned_from_the_soon_to_be_Longest_Running_Cognitive_Model/links/6490a763c41fb852dd18ce5e/Long-Road-Ahead-Lessons-Learned-from-the-soon-to-be-Longest-Running-Cognitive-Model.pdf)and cognitively-inspired decision intelligence for manufacturing (http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). 
* Explainable AI, realized through the infusion of cognitive reasoning into generative models.
