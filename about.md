I passed my PhD qualifying exam with an outstanding score from The Pennsylvania State University, College of Information Sciences and Technology, advised by <a href="https://www.frankritter.com/ritter.html">Frank Ritter</a>.

In my work, I study 
* Neural symbolic AI, applications including <a href="https://www.frankritter.com/papers/wuBRT23.pdf">autonomous driving</a> and <a href="http://Siyuwu528.github.io/images/NeSyAI-ACS-2024_extended.pdf" target="_blank">cognitively-inspired decision intelligence for manufacturing</a>
* Explainable AI, realized through the infusion of cognitive reasoning into generative models.<a href="http://Siyuwu528.github.io/images/V4_AI-WEEK-2024-LLM-ACT-R-1.pdf">poster on Annual Ethical AI Symposium, University of Michigan Institute for Data Science</a> |
